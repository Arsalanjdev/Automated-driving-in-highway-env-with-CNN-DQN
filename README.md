# Automated-driving-in-highway-env-with-CNN-DQN
This repository presents a project focused on automated driving in the highway-env environment using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

#How to run:
Run main.py.

#Todo:
- Change the architecture of the CNN network for a better result
- Reduce the computational load
- Try for a faster convergence
- Try different variations of DQN
- Add requirements.txt
